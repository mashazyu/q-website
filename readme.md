This is an example of how styling could look like.

- I took about page as an example and styled mobile and desktop views in accordance with the provided design, breakpoint is at 768px.
- To check styling out, please clone repo/copy files with file structure locally and open projects.html in browser.
- To check out breakpoint, you can either play with the browser window size directly or by righ-clicking & Inspect (Untersuchen)


What is in to do for this page:
- top menu
- nice plants on the desktop resolution
- refactoring

Open questions:
- Is this styling smth that you could imagine working with?
- Are there any requirements for the file structure?
